* `{"foo": <bar>, "baz": <quux>}` denotes a JSON object (in the body of
  the request).

# Full Api spec:

## Users

### user_create

`PUT /user/<username>`

Request body:

    {
        "password": <plaintext-password>
    }

Create a new user whose password is `<plaintext-password>`.

Possible errors:

* 409, if the user already exists

### user_delete

`DELETE /user/<username>`

Delete the user whose username is `<username>`

Possible errors:

* 404, if the user does not exist

## Networks

### show_network

`GET /network/<network>`

View detailed information about `<network>`.

The result contains the following information:

* The name of the network
* A description of legal channel identifiers for this network. This is a list
  of channel identifiers, with possible wildcards. The format of these is
  driver specific, see below.

Response body (on success):

    {
        "name": <network>
        "channels": <chanel-id-list>
    }

Possible errors:

* 404, if the network does not exist.

#### Channel Formats

##### 802.1q VLAN based drivers

Channel identifiers for the VLAN based drivers are one of:

* `vlan/native`, to attach the network as the native (untagged) VLAN
* `vlan/<vlan_id>` where `<vlan_id>` is a VLAN id number. This attaches
   the network in tagged, mode, with the given VLAN id.

Additionally, the `show_networks` api call may return the channel identifier
`vlan/*`, which indicates that any VLAN-based channel id may be used.

Where documentation specifies that the network driver should choose a
default channel, the VLAN drivers choose `vlan/native`.

### node_connect_network

`POST /node/<node>/nic/<nic>/connect_network`

Request body:

    {
        "network": <network>,
        "channel": <channel> (Optional)
    }

Connect the network named `<network>` to `<nic>` on `<channel>`.

`<channel>` should be a legal channel identifier specified by the output
of `show_network`, above. If `<channel>` is omitted, the driver will choose
a default, which should be some form of "untagged."

Networks are connected and detached asynchronously. If successful, this
API call returns a status code of 202 Accepted, and queues the network
operation to be preformed. Each nic may have no more than one pending
network operation; an attempt to queue a second action will result in an
error.

Possible errors:

* 409, if:
  * The current project does not control `<node>`.
  * The current project does not have access to `<network>`.
  * There is already a pending network operation on `<nic>`.
  * `<network>` is already attached to `<nic>` (possibly on a different channel).
  * The channel identifier is not legal for this network.

### node_detach_network

`POST /node/<node>/nic/<nic>/detach_network`

Request body:

    {
        "network": <network>
    }

Detach `<network>` from `<nic>`.

Networks are connected and detached asynchronously. If successful, this
API call returns a status code of 202 Accepted, and queues the network
operation to be preformed. Each nic may have no more than one pending
network operation; an attempt to queue a second action will result in an
error.

Possible Errors:

* 409, if:
  * The current project does not control `<node>`.
  * There is already a pending network operation on `<nic>`.
  * `<network>` is not attached to `<nic>`.

## Switches

### switch_register

Register a network switch of type `<type>`

`<type>` (a string) is the type of network switch. The possible values
depend on what drivers HaaS is configured to use. The remainder of the
fields are driver-specific; see the documentation for the driver in
question (in `docs/network-drivers.md`.

`PUT /switch/<switch>`

Request body:

    {
        "type": <type>,
        (extra args; depends on <type>)
    }

Possible Errors:

* 409, if a switch named `<switch>` already exists.

### switch_delete

`DELETE /switch/<switch>`

Delete the switch named `<switch>`.

Prior to deleting a switch, all of the switch's ports must first be
deleted.

Possible Errors:

* 404, if the named switch does not exist
* 409, if not all of the switch's ports have been deleted.

### switch_register_port

`PUT /switch/<switch>/port/<port>`

Register a port `<port>` on `<switch>`.

The permissable values of `<port>`, and their meanings, are switch
specific; see the documentation for the apropriate driver for more
information.

Possible Errors:

* 404, if the named switch does not exist
* 409, if the port already exists

### switch_delete_port

`DELETE /switch/<switch>/port/<port>`

Delete the named `<port>` on `<switch>`.

Prior to deleting a port, any nic attached to it must be removed.

Possible Errors:

* 404, if the port or switch does not exist
* 409, if there is a nic attached to the port.
