The function `wsgi_handler` is the wsgi entry point to the app.

def rest_call(method, path, schema=None):
    """A decorator which registers an http mapping to a python api call.

    `rest_call` makes no modifications to the function itself, though the
    function need not worry about most of the details of the http request, see
    below for details.

    Arguments:

    * path - the url-path to map the function to. The format is the same as for
            werkzeug's router (e.g. '/foo/<bar>/baz')
    * method - the HTTP method for the api call (e.g. POST, GET...)
    * schema (optional) - an instance of ``schema.Schema`` with which to
            validate the body of the request. It should assume its argument is
            a JSON object, represented as a python ``dict``.

            If this is omitted, ``moc-rest`` will generate a schema which
            verifies that all of the expected arguments exist and are strings
            (see below).

            ``schema`` MUST ensure that none of the arguments in ``path`` are
            also found in the body of the request.

    Any parameters to the function not designated in the url will be pulled
    from a json object in the body of the requests.

    For example, given::

        @rest_call('POST', '/some-url/<bar>/<baz>')
        def foo(bar, baz, quux):
            pass

    When a POST request to ``/some-url/*/*`` occurs, ``foo`` will be invoked
    with its ``bar`` and ``baz`` arguments pulled from the url, and its
    ``quux`` from the body. So, the request::

        POST /some-url/alice/bob HTTP/1.1
        <headers...>

        {"quux": "eve"}

    Will invoke ``foo('alice', 'bob', 'eve')``.

    If the function raises an `APIError`, the error will be reported to the
    client with the exception's status_code attribute as the return status, and
    a json object such as:

        {
            "type": "MissingArgumentError",
            "msg": "The required argument FOO was not supplied."
        }

    as the body, i.e. `type` will be the type of the exception, and `msg`
    will be a human-readable error message.

    If no exception is raised, the return value must be one of:

        * None (implicit if there's no ``return`` statement), in which case
          the response code will be 200 and the body will be empty
        * A string, which will be used as the body of the response. again,
          the status code will be 200.
        * A tuple, whose first element is a string (the response body), and
          whose second is an integer (the status code).
