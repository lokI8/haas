**HaaS**
========

HaaS is a low-level tool for reserving physical machines and connecting
them via isolated networks. It does not prescribe a particular
method for imaging/managing said machines, allowing the user to use
any solution of their choosing.

HaaS keeps track of available resources in a database, which a system
administrator must populate initially. 

**This includes information such as:**

- What machines are available
- What network interfaces they have
- Where those NICs are connected (what port on what switch)

**From there, a regular user may:**

- Reserve physical machines
- Create isolated logical networks
- Create "headnodes," which are small virtual machines usable for
  management/provisioning purposes
- Connect network interfaces belonging to physical and/or headnodes to
  logical networks.
- Reboot their machines, view the serial consoles -- aditionaly such management
  features may exist in the future.

**A typical user workflow might look like:**

1. Reserve some machines.
#. Create a logical "provisioning" network.
#. Connect a NIC from each machine to the provisioning network. In particular,
   one could connect a NIC from which the machine will attempt to boot.
#. Create a headnode, and attach it to the provisioning network
#. Log in to the headnode, set up a PXE server, reboot the nodes, and deploy an
   operating system on them via the network.

**Getting Started**
===================

See ``INSTALL.rst`` for details on setting up HaaS. You should also read
``docs/overview.md`` to get a sense of how HaaS operates. ``docs/apidesc.md``
describes the API at a conceptual level (enough to use it via the ``haas``
command line tool), and ``docs/rest_api.md`` provides a detailed mapping of that
API to http requests.

**Hacking**
===========

This project is part of the larger Massachusetts Open Cloud, for a list
of authors, description of the team, development workflow, etc. see:

https://github.com/CCI-MOC/moc-public/blob/master/README.md

The file ``HACKING.rst`` In this directory describes the technical details
of running HaaS in development.

There is also some assorted documentation in the `doc/` directory.
